# MDEditor

## Written in wxWidgets

## Aims:

- To be fast and reliable.

- To run on old hardware (target
at least Windows XP and OSX
Tiger).
This is made possible by
wxWidgets which can target
Windows 98 and
macOS 9.

- To help me learn wxWidgets.


## Tests:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
printf("Hello World!\n");

return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
